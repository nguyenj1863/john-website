                    Going into my first hackathon, I was completely lost ~ especially after both of my teammates were rejected. I ended up joining a group of other first-timers, and we got inspired by a Deloitte event on sustainability. Motivated by the idea (and the prize: a Snorlax plushie), we built a map that analyzed Toronto neighborhoods based on sustainability factors.

                    Most of us were new to coding, so it was a learning experience from start to finish. One of our biggest challenges was finding reliable open data, but in the process, we learned a lot about sustainability and urban planning, stuff we would have never considered before. Even though we didnâ€™t win the cute Snorlax plushie, working with such a fun and curious team made the whole experience unforgettable.
